# Wireshark Network Analysis Lab

## Overview
This project uses **Wireshark** to capture and analyze live network traffic in a virtual machine environment. It was completed as part of the Grand Canyon University ITT-307: Cybersecurity Foundations course.

Wireshark was used to apply protocol filters (e.g., DNS, TCP, IP), review flow graphs, trace communication paths, and interpret packet metadata. The lab also compared the value of packet analysis vs. traditional vulnerability assessments.

## Objectives
- Capture real-time network packets using Wireshark
- Filter traffic by protocol and analyze header data
- Identify IP addresses, MACs, ports, and traffic anomalies
- Compare network behavior to vulnerability assessment reports

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark
- Virtual Machine (Windows or Linux host)
- DNS, TCP, and IP packet filtering
- Flow graph analysis

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Network Detection & Response (NDR)
- Packet-level forensics
- Network protocol dissection
- Traffic anomaly detection
- Digital forensics fundamentals
